# BELP Happy Hour Finder
## Let BELP help you discover your best Happy Hour

* BELP allows users to view and add happy hours to a database.  All happy hours show:
    * Bar name
    * HH start
    * HH end
    * Price (rated from 1-5)
    * Rating of the happy hour (rated from 1-5)

* Google Maps is used to show the user a map of the Philadelphia area.

* This was a group project, breakout below:
    * Pam: Handlebars, heroku app deployment, styles and presentation
    * Aaron: Add route, object creation, POST route, POST test
    * Robert: Google Maps API, Google Markers API, Google Geocoder API, database creation
    * Zhane: Database creation, routing, chalk implementation

* Challenges faced:
    * Branch merges
    * Meeting times
    * Google Maps markers not populating

* Future Improvements for BELP:
    * Allow additional cities, not just Philly, to be accessed
        * There would be a drop down on the View Happy Hours from the homepage where you could select a city
    * Incorporate a Cocktails API for a listing of drinks you can try while at your next happy hour
    * Have a way for users to create their own group to:
        * Allow sharing of favorite happy hours with their friends
        * Create a personalized list of places to try
    * Geocode addresses and add map markers
    * Allow users to input their own rating for each location and return an average rating
